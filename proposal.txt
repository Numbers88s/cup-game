Proposal
--------
Team Name: Group3

We're making a game.
Based on the classic cup and ball game.

Ideas include making the number of elements dynamic between 3 and 7 (more than 3 is stretch goal)

User selects parameters:

Number of shuffles
Speed
Different items to shuffle(stretch goal)

User is shown the picture they are supposed to keep track of. Shuffling begins. Music Starts (stretch goal)

During shuffle start button and options are disabled until animation is complete.

User selects the picture they believe is the right answer. Feedback is given.

If correct, score is updated and we will use local storage to keep record of the high score.


Three pages/domain model:

About Us.
Options Selection Page.
Animation Page.
Score Page.
