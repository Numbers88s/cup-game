This is a game based on the cup and ball shuffling game. Instead of using a cup we using a picture of Slash and instead of the ball we are using a family of owls under Slash's hat. The game starts off by displaying a start page with option parameters for the game. The option parameters are: number of shuffles and speed. The higher the number of shuffles and the faster the speed the more points the user will score if they win the game. The user makes their options selection and clicks the start button, which takes them to the game page.

The game page consists of three square images of Slash. When the game page is loaded the owl family will reveal themselves before the shuffling begins. The user will track the image containing the owls till then shuffling is done. Once the shuffling is over the user will click the Slash image they believe to contain the owl family. If they click the right image it will display a pop up saying 'you win!' and if your score happens to be a new high school the pop up will say 'new high score' and will prompt the user to enter their initials. If they click the wrong image the pop up with say 'you lose' and prompt the user to click the link the high scores page. Once the user either enters their initials for a new high score or clicks link to the high score page the high score page will be displayed. From the high score page the user can click the link to play again or view the about us page.
